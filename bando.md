### Description of the proposed project, including aims and approach (maximum 2500 characters).

Despite being one of the most authoritative sources of knowledge, the Wikimedia ecosystem is affected by issues related to discrimination of minorities and minoritized groups. Our research project addresses such an issue by proposing a pipeline for the identification and mitigation of such issue based on fine-grained biographical-event detection (Stranisci et al. 2023). The project is organized in 2 steps:

1. Intrinsic evaluation of biographies. We will gather all English Wikipedia biographies with a corresponding Wikidata page, automatically extract their biographical events and identifies forms of underrepresentation and social biases

2. Extrinsic evaluation. We will create a tool that, given the Wikipedia biography of a person, it gather a number of external documents about the same entity and transform them in structured knowledge, in order to identify potential mitigation strategies [**qualcosa su C-DUCE?**]

Outcomes of the project
1. A tool that quantifies biases and underrepresentation of all people in English Wikipedia is released and update quarterly
2. A tool for the discovery of new and less biased sources of knowledge about people will be made accessible to Wikimedia contributors.

### Impact and relevance of the work to Wikimedia projects, including the degree to which the research will address the 2030 Wikimedia Strategic Direction and / or support the work of Wikimedia user groups, affiliates, and developer communities (maximum 750 characters).

The project is expected to have a crucial impact in the development of a transparent methodology for the evaluation of the quality of knowledge expressed in the Wikimedia ecosystem. Our work will contribute to measure objective vulnerabilities that are present in Wikipedia biographies. This will ensure (i) a more informed decision-making process between Wikimedia contributors and (ii) a continuous support to the identification of content gaps in Wikipedia and Wikidata.

### Budget description (maximum 500 characters).


### Plans for dissemination (maximum 500 characters).

During the development of our technologies, a series of data-driven thematic insights will be disseminated through our University communication channels. Additionally, our tools will be presented to local groups that work on the topic of discrimination and to minorities and minoritized communities.
Results of the project will be presented at the Wiki Workshop 2024 (**oppure 2025**)

### Prior contributions to related academic and / or research projects and / or the Wikimedia and free culture communities. If none, then an explanation of planned contributions (maximum 750 characters).
