# $\mathbb{C}Duce$ as a tool to validate ontologies

### Introduction

$\mathbb{C}$Duce allows the developer to describe the structure of an XML document by designing a type for each kind of node we want to represent, and by describing which nodes can be its children, via a list of the types of admissible children nodes. 

##### An example

```ocaml
type Class = <owl:Class rdf:about=String> [ ClassAtt * ]

type ClassAtt = SubClass | EqClass | Label | Note 
type SubClass = <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=String> []
type EqClass  = <owl:equivalentClass> [ EqAttr ] 
              | <owl:equivalentClass rdf:resource=String> []
type EqAttr   = <owl:Restriction> [ AnyXml* ]
type Label    = <rdfs:label xml:lang=String> String
type Note     = <skos:scopeNote xml:lang=String> String
```

The example above shows how we describe a 'Class' type by specifying the tag opening the element, and by supplying a list of possible attributes for 'Class'. Any element that respects such a structure is identified as a 'Class'.

## Validation

If we describe the ontology structure of interest with a CDuce type, we can verify if the structure of any XML document is compatible with the expected one, described by the CDuce type. This verification can be done with a runtime cast. If the cast fails, it raises an exception showing the exact incorrect point in the XML document. 

This high-level procedure is useful to validate any knowledge base expressed in XML, with respect to a given structure described via a CDuce type.


## Transformation

We can also be interested in transforming a well-formed XML document [NOTA: ben formato rispetto a cosa? Se fosse rispetto ai tipi dell'ontologia in cui vogliamo trasformarlo non ci sarebbe bisogno di trasformarlo...] into an ontology of a given CDuce type. 

We start from the hypothesis that the document contains both compatible and non-compatible elements with respect the target type. We will then select all the compatible elements by using 'transform' [NOTA: il lettore non sa cos'Ã¨...] and/or queries/projections. This selection can be performed at different levels of depth:

- by selecting only classes, individuals and relationships that respects the description given by the CDuce type;

- by selecting only attributes that respects the description given by the CDuce type: in this case, we start from a class/individual/relationship that owns both admissible and non-admissible attributes and we extract a structure containg compatible attributes only;

- by selecting all the elements, compatible and non-compatible, the latter to be made compatible with appropriate transformations.

The procedure of Transformation allows the developer to start from a knowledge base which is not compatible with respect to a CDuce type (partially or totally) and to obtain an ontology matching completely the CDuce type.


## Conclusions

Both Validation and Transformation are supported by the $\mathbb{C}$Duce static type checking, that guarantees a formal soundness with respect to the sought types of the transformations and of the results obtained.
